# Initial Setup

# Project Structure
* As flat as possible, stick to style guide recommendations
* Nest components if they are only needed inside another component
* Consider shared services vs services local to container components
* Separate `NgModule` per page/route can work
* Consider lazy loading vs eager loading of modules
* Core module for dependencies that need to be instantiated only once

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
